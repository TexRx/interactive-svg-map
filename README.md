# Interactive SVG Map
This project demonstrates how to create an interactive map using SVG as the map source.

## Goals
The goals of this project are:

* Generate an optimized SVG file for a global map of all countries as individual paths
* Be able to interact directly with each individual country on the map
* Be able to interact indirectly with each individual country on the map via interactions with user interface elements that are not a part of the map

## Dependencies
* Babel
* Gulp
* gulp-svgmin
* gulp-sass
* gulp-sequence

## How to build the map SVG

## How to build the project
From the console:

```bash
> npm run build
```

Or, if you want to start a small server that refreshes when your source files are changed, you can run:

```bash
> npm run serve
```

## Development
